}

CLOSED LABEL SET for dissonance_type (use EXACTLY one):
- interruption — agent talked over the customer, overlapping speech, or cut the customer off mid-sentence
- dismissive_tone — agent used curt, blaming, or impatient language (CS-RULE-008 style) without clear overlap
- missing_acknowledgment — agent jumped to verification/script without acknowledging the customer's stated concern
- none — no agent behavioral friction; detected emotion shift is not explained by agent interruption/dismissal

IMPORTANT: Do NOT output sarcasm, passive_aggression, or cross_modal. The acoustic/text emotion is ALREADY provided.
Your job is ONLY to diagnose which AGENT behavior (if any) caused the negative emotion shift.

DECISION ORDER:
1. interruption — overlapping speech, interruption, or agent speaking over customer
2. dismissive_tone — curt/blaming/dismissive/rude/impatient agent lines
3. missing_acknowledgment — procedural jump without empathy/acknowledgment
4. none — only when there is no credible agent-fault evidence

TIE-BREAK RULES:
- If BOTH interruption and dismissive tone are present, choose interruption.
- If agent line sounds polite but skips acknowledgment of customer concern, choose missing_acknowledgment.
- Use none only when transcript evidence does not support any agent behavioral cause.

CONSERVATIVE BIAS (avoid false positives — empathy must reward good agents):
- Default to "none". Only choose interruption / dismissive_tone / missing_acknowledgment when you can
  put an EXACT verbatim AGENT line in evidence_quotes that demonstrates the friction.
- Do NOT infer friction from the customer's emotion alone. A frustrated or anxious customer is not
  proof of agent fault — the agent can be empathetic toward an upset customer.
- A polite, on-script, or efficient agent is "none". Verification questions, hold requests, and
  procedural steps are NOT friction unless the agent is curt/blaming or cuts the customer off.
- If your only evidence quote is a CUSTOMER line, the verdict is "none".

NLI_CATEGORY_DEFINITIONS = """
Choose exactly ONE category (verdict and nli_category must be identical strings):

CLASSIFICATION ORDER (apply top-to-bottom; stop at first match):
1. Policy Hallucination — agent cites a fee, threshold, approval requirement, timeline, or rule that does NOT appear in the policy text (fabricated/invented).
   Use Policy Hallucination even when the statement also conflicts with policy. Example: inventing a $25 processing fee or mandatory manager approval when policy allows frontline credits up to $200.
2. Contradiction — agent violates an explicit constraint stated IN the policy (wrong verification count, exceeds a cap, prohibited action). The violating rule must come from policy text — not invented by the agent.
3. Benign Deviation — empathy, minor procedural shortcut, or skipped hold script WITH explicit justification, and NO hard policy violation.
   Example: $50 goodwill credit with documented reason when policy requires supervisor approval only for credits OVER $50.
4. Entailment — agent statement is fully supported by the policy text.

Category definitions:
- Entailment — agent statement is fully supported by the policy text.
- Benign Deviation — agent adds empathy, small talk, or skips a minor procedural step BUT
  (a) does not contradict policy, AND (b) explicitly states a justification or empathetic framing
  for the deviation. Example: acknowledging stress before verification.
- Contradiction — agent statement violates policy, OR skips a required step/count WITHOUT
  justification. Example: performing a financial adjustment after only 2-of-5 verification factors
  when policy requires 3-of-5 — even if empathetic language is present.
- Policy Hallucination — agent cites a rule, fee, threshold, or approval requirement not present in policy.

DISTINGUISHING RULE (Benign Deviation vs Contradiction):
If the agent explicitly states a justification for deviating from strict procedure AND the statement
does not violate a numeric/rule constraint → Benign Deviation.
If the agent violates a hard policy constraint (counts, caps, timelines, prohibited actions) → Contradiction,
regardless of empathetic language.

DISTINGUISHING RULE (Policy Hallucination vs Contradiction):
Invented fees, approval rules, or thresholds not in policy → Policy Hallucination (not Contradiction).
Misstating or breaking a rule that IS in policy → Contradiction.

CONSERVATIVE BIAS (avoid false positives):
- Choose Contradiction or Policy Hallucination ONLY when you can quote the specific policy clause
  that is violated or that the agent fabricated. If you cannot point to such a clause, the statement
  is NOT a violation.
- An agent CORRECTLY denying a request, enforcing a rule, or following the documented procedure is
  Entailment — not a Contradiction. Denying something the policy does not allow is compliance.
- When the statement is consistent with policy and no clause is clearly breached, choose Entailment.
- Reserve "critical" severity for genuine regulatory/financial/identity harm; do not inflate severity.
