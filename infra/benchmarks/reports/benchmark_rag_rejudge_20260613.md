## VocalMind Ollama Cloud Model Benchmark — 2026-06-13 16:04 UTC

### Cost methodology
Ollama Cloud does not publish per-token prices — it bills on GPU time consumed,
which depends on model size (usage level 1–4) and request duration.
We therefore show two cost columns:
  - groq_equivalent_usd: what the same token volume would cost on Groq for the
    nearest equivalent model family. Use this to sanity-check token efficiency.
  - openai_equivalent_usd: same calculation against gpt-4o-mini as a market anchor.
To convert to Ollama Cloud subscription cost: divide your Pro/Max plan monthly fee
by your estimated monthly call count. VocalMind's 3-chain trigger runs ~24 LLM
calls per interaction (3 chains × ~8 windows). At 500 interactions/month that is
~12,000 calls/month → $0.0017/call on Pro, $0.0083/call on Max.
