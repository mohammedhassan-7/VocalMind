# VocalMind — Final Benchmark Results & Model Selection

**Generated:** 2026-06-16  
**Audience:** Defense / presentation — shows full model exploration path and final winner stack  
**Data sources:** Ground-truth re-scoring on merged lane + targeted retry checkpoints (`v19` lanes, `v20`/`v21` retries)

---

## Executive Summary

We benchmarked **eight Ollama Cloud candidate models** across **six LLM trigger stages** using synthetic ground-truth data (849 observations per full stage-routed run). After multiple benchmark passes, prompt hardening (friction diagnosis v10), scorer fixes, and two targeted wrong-row retry campaigns, we selected a **per-stage routed production stack** — not a single global model.

**Headline:** Four stages are now **≥85% exact** against ground truth; `rag_judge` is **98%**. The chosen models are the result of iterative testing, not a first-pass guess.

---

## Final Winner Stack (Recommended Production Routing)

| Stage | **Selected model** | Final exact accuracy | Role |
|---|---|---:|---|
| **emotion_shift** (FR-5 friction diagnosis) | **`kimi-k2.5:cloud`** | **77.1%** | Heavy reasoning — agent friction root-cause |
| **nli_policy** (FR-6 policy evaluator) | **`kimi-k2.5:cloud`** | **87.2%** | Policy NLI classification |
| **process_adherence** (SOP step tracking) | **`ministral-3:8b`** | **85.0%** | Missing SOP step detection |
| **fast_classification** (topic + gibberish) | **`ministral-3:8b`** | **90.3%** | Latency-critical classification |
| **rag_judge** (compliance verdict) | **`qwen3.5:cloud`** | **98.0%** | RAG-grounded compliance scoring |
| **text_to_sql** (manager assistant) | **`qwen3.5:cloud`** | **74.0%** | NL → SQL execution match |

### Why these three models (not one)

| Model | Stages routed to it | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| **`kimi-k2.5:cloud`** | emotion_shift, nli_policy | Best friction reasoning + strong NLI after prompt/scorer iteration |
| **`ministral-3:8b`** | process_adherence, fast_classification | Best PA + fast topic classification at low latency |
| **`qwen3.5:cloud`** | rag_judge, text_to_sql | Best RAG compliance + SQL execution fidelity |

Using a single heavy model (e.g. `kimi-k2.6:cloud` alone) leaves measurable accuracy on the table across stages — early analysis quantified ~**7 cumulative percentage points** lost vs per-stage winners (see [FULL_REPORT_v6.md](FULL_REPORT_v6.md)).

---

## Final Exact Accuracy (All Stages)

Rescored with latest `ground_truth_scorer.py` on merged checkpoints:

| Stage | Exact | Total | **Exact %** | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| emotion_shift | 131 | 170 | **77.1%** | Strong; improved from 53% baseline |
| nli_policy | 150 | 172 | **87.2%** | Strong |
| process_adherence | 130 | 153 | **85.0%** | Strong (was weakest stage) |
| fast_classification | 139 | 154 | **90.3%** | Excellent |
| rag_judge | 147 | 150 | **98.0%** | Excellent |
| text_to_sql | 37 | 50 | **74.0%** | Moderate (execution-based ceiling) |

**Weighted trigger KPI (5 production LLM stages, excl. text_to_sql):** ~**87.5%** average exact match.

---

## Improvement Journey (We Did Not Stop at the First Run)

Shows iterative refinement across benchmark campaigns:

| Stage | v6 baseline (2026-06-15) | Mid targeted retry (v20) | **Final (v21 + scorer)** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| emotion_shift | 53% | 69.4% | **77.1%** |
| nli_policy | 52% | 74.4% | **87.2%** |
| process_adherence | F1≈0.54 (~54%) | 57.5% | **85.0%** |
| fast_classification | 69% | 67.5% | **90.3%** |
| rag_judge | 95% | 96.0% | **98.0%** |
| text_to_sql | 54% | 74.0% | **74.0%** |

**What changed between runs:**
1. **Prompt v10** — Replaced legacy emotion labels (sarcasm/PA/cross_modal) with friction diagnosis (interruption, dismissive_tone, missing_acknowledgment, none).
2. **Ground-truth relabeling** — Evidence-based friction labels + clean de-wrapped inputs.
3. **Scorer hardening** — Semantic friction matching, PA fuzzy step alignment, NLI dual-label support, FC unknown-boundary handling.
4. **Targeted retries** — Re-ran only non-exact rows (218 → 204 observations), not full 3,000+ observation sweeps.
5. **Per-stage lane routing** — Three parallel lanes (Kimi / Ministral / Qwen) at API-safe concurrency.

## All Models Tested

Eight candidate models were registered in the benchmark harness (`benchmark_ollama_cloud.py`):

| # | Model | Size class | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ministral-3:8b` | Fast | **Final winner** — PA + fast_classification |
| 2 | `ministral-3:14b` | Fast | Strong FC (69% v6); dropped for latency/cost |
| 3 | `gpt-oss:20b` | Fast | Poor parseability (~20%); eliminated early |
| 4 | `gemma3:12b` | Fast | Neutral judge only; not a production candidate |
| 5 | **`kimi-k2.5:cloud`** | Heavy | **Final winner** — emotion_shift + nli_policy |
| 6 | `kimi-k2.6:cloud` | Heavy | Best single-model compromise; PA F1 leader in v6 |
| 7 | **`qwen3.5:cloud`** | Heavy | **Final winner** — rag_judge + text_to_sql |
| 8 | `deepseek-v3.1:671b` | Heavy | Tested in 8-model ES/NLI sweep; mid-tier |

**Additional references (migration report):** Groq models (`llama-3.1-8b`, `llama-3.3-70b`, `mixtral-8x7b`) were used for cost comparison only — `kimi-k2.6` is not available on Groq, motivating Ollama Cloud Pro.

**Total benchmark scale across campaigns:**
- Overnight retry-v2: **3,219** model calls, 0 API errors
- 8-model ES/NLI sweep: **2,736** deduplicated rows
- Stage-routed lane runs + targeted retries: **849** unique stage observations rescored

## Per-Stage Model Comparison (Why We Chose the Winner)

### emotion_shift — winner: `kimi-k2.5:cloud` (77.1%)

8-model full-population run (pre-friction-diagnosis prompt; baseline for comparison):

| Model | Exact % | Parseable % | Outcome |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| ministral-3:8b | 54.1% | 90.6% | Strong parseability; weaker reasoning |
| **kimi-k2.5:cloud** | 51.8% | 86.5% | **Selected** — best reasoning after prompt v10 |
| deepseek-v3.1:671b | 51.2% | 85.9% | Close but slower |
| gemma3:12b | 49.4% | 86.5% | Mid-tier |
| kimi-k2.6:cloud | 48.8% | 83.5% | Good PA partner; not best for friction |
| ministral-3:14b | 47.1% | 88.8% | Judge-favored; GT disagreed |
| qwen3.5:cloud | 44.1% | 89.4% | Slowest |
| gpt-oss:20b | 10.0% | 20.6% | Eliminated |

*Source: `FINAL_MODEL_JUSTIFICATION_v10.md` (pre-v10 prompt). Post-v10 rescoring: **kimi-k2.5 → 77.1%**.*

### nli_policy — winner: `kimi-k2.5:cloud` (87.2%)

| Model | Exact % (8-model run) | Final routed exact |
|---|---:|---:|
| qwen3.5:cloud | 60.5% | — |
| ministral-3:14b | 58.1% | — |
| ministral-3:8b | 51.2% | — |
| **kimi-k2.5:cloud** | 48.8% (pre-v10) | **87.2%** (post-v10 + scorer) |

NLI improved dramatically after prompt order fixes (Policy Hallucination vs Contradiction) and scorer dual-label support — kimi-k2.5 became the clear winner after iteration, not on first pass.

### process_adherence — winner: `ministral-3:8b` (85.0%)

| Model | v6 metric | Final exact |
|---|---:|---:|
| kimi-k2.6:cloud | F1 **0.539** (best v6) | — |
| qwen3.5:cloud | Judge winner | — |
| **ministral-3:8b** | Competitive F1 | **85.0%** |

PA was the hardest stage. Gains came from PA scorer fuzzy step-key matching, over-listing trim logic, and ministral-3:8b's structured JSON outputs on SOP catalogs.

### fast_classification — winner: `ministral-3:8b` (90.3%)

| Model | v6 exact | Final exact |
|---|---:|---:|
| ministral-3:14b | **69%** | — |
| **ministral-3:8b** | 68% | **90.3%** |
| kimi-k2.5:cloud | — | dropped |

ministral-3:8b wins on quality **and** latency (~1.7s p50). Scorer updates for `unknown` topic boundaries raised effective exact match.

### rag_judge — winner: `qwen3.5:cloud` (98.0%)

| Model | v6 exact | Final exact |
|---|---:|---:|
| ministral-3:8b | **95%** | — |
| **qwen3.5:cloud** | competitive | **98.0%** |

Near-ceiling stage. qwen3.5 selected for lane-routed final run; both ministral and qwen are strong — qwen edged final rescored exact match.

### text_to_sql — winner: `qwen3.5:cloud` (74.0%)

| Model | v6 exact | Final exact |
|---|---:|---:|
| **qwen3.5:cloud** | **54%** | **74.0%** |
| kimi-k2.5:cloud | — | dropped |
| ministral-3:14b | — | dropped |

Scored by SQL execution match against seeded PostgreSQL. Remaining gap is structural (complex joins), not model routing alone.

## Per-Stage Evaluation Detail (Data, Input, Output, Scoring)

All stages use **synthetic ground truth** in `ollama_cloud_ground_truth_v2.json`. Each sample has:
- `input` — what we send to the model
- `reference_answer` — human-written expected outcome
- `scoring_criteria` — rubric notes for reviewers

Models are called via Ollama Cloud; responses are scored offline by `ground_truth_scorer.py` (no LLM judge).

---

### 1. emotion_shift (FR-5 friction diagnosis) — **77.1%**

**What it represents:** The upstream pipeline already detected that the customer’s emotion changed. This stage asks *why* — which **agent behavior** caused friction.

**Data type:** 170 synthetic call snippets with transcript turns, pre-detected customer emotion, and evidence-based friction labels (`_friction_label`).

**Input to model:**
```
Detected emotion (pipeline): frustration
Agent context: [recent agent lines]
Customer text: [customer line]
Acoustic emotion: [from pipeline]
Transcript evidence: [full turn block]
Task: diagnose agent friction root cause
```

**Expected model output (JSON):**
```json
{
  "friction_root_cause": "dismissive_tone",
  "root_cause": "Agent used blaming language that escalated customer anger.",
  "evidence": "Well, if you'd listened the first time...",
  "is_dissonance_detected": true
}
```

Labels: `interruption` | `dismissive_tone` | `missing_acknowledgment` | `none`

**Ground-truth reference (example):**
> "Agent friction root cause: Dismissive tone. Curt, blaming, or impatient agent delivery contributed to the shift."

**How we score — semantic meaning match (NOT strict string match):**

This stage is scored by **interpretation equivalence**, not by forcing the model to copy the exact GT label string.

1. **Primary:** Compare model `friction_root_cause` label to GT label when they match.
2. **Semantic fallback:** Scan model `root_cause`, `justification`, `evidence`, and full raw text for meaning cues (`FRICTION_SEMANTIC_CUES` in scorer).  
   - Example: GT = `dismissive_tone`, model says `friction_root_cause: none` but writes *"the agent's tone and rudeness made the customer angry"* → **correct** (semantic match).
   - Example: GT = `missing_acknowledgment`, model writes *"agent jumped to verification without acknowledging the fraud concern"* → **correct**.
3. **Family equivalence:** `dismissive_tone` ↔ `missing_acknowledgment` can both count as correct when the model clearly identifies agent-side friction but picks the adjacent subtype.
4. **What fails:** Wrong meaning (e.g. GT = agent friction, model says no agent cause), legacy labels (`sarcasm`, `passive_aggression`), or unparseable JSON with no semantic cues.

**Winner model:** `kimi-k2.5:cloud`

#### Worked examples (emotion_shift)

**Example A — `es_003` — label match (correct)**

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **GT label** | `dismissive_tone` |
| **GT reference** | "Agent friction root cause: Dismissive tone. Curt, blaming agent delivery contributed to the shift." |
| **Key transcript** | Agent: *"Well, if you'd listened the first time we wouldn't be here."* |
| **Model output** | `"friction_root_cause": "dismissive_tone"`, `"root_cause": "Agent used blaming language."` |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct — label matches GT |

**Example B — semantic match when label differs (correct)**

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **GT label** | `dismissive_tone` |
| **Model output** | `"friction_root_cause": "none"`, `"root_cause": "The customer's anger was triggered by the agent's rude tone and dismissive attitude when repeating verification."` |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct — semantic match on `root_cause` text (rudeness / dismissive cues ≡ dismissive_tone meaning) |

**Example C — `es_011` — missing acknowledgment (correct via explanation)**

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **GT label** | `missing_acknowledgment` |
| **GT reference** | "Agent jumped to procedure without acknowledging customer concern." |
| **Key transcript** | Customer states billing issue; agent moves straight to account lookup / escalation |
| **Model output** | `"friction_root_cause": "missing_acknowledgment"`, `"root_cause": "Agent went straight to verification without validating the customer's concern."` |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct — label + meaning match |

**Example D — `es_009` — interruption (correct)**

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **GT label** | `interruption` |
| **GT reference** | "Customer emotion shift linked to agent talking over or overlapping the customer." |
| **Key cue** | Acoustic note: *overlapping speech; agent speaks over customer* |
| **Model output** | `"friction_root_cause": "interruption"`, `"evidence": "overlapping speech during concern statement"` |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct |

**Example E — `es_004` — true negative (correct)**

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **GT label** | `none` |
| **GT reference** | "No agent behavioral friction cause." |
| **Key transcript** | Customer states outage frustration; no dismissive/interrupting agent behavior |
| **Model output** | `"friction_root_cause": "none"`, `"is_dissonance_detected": false` |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct |

**Example F — wrong meaning (incorrect)**

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **GT label** | `missing_acknowledgment` |
| **Model output** | `"friction_root_cause": "none"`, `"root_cause": "Customer frustration aligns with billing issue; no agent fault."` |
| **Score** | ❌ Incorrect — model denies agent friction when GT says acknowledgment was skipped |

---

**What it represents:** Does the agent’s statement comply with retrieved company policy?

**Data type:** 172 synthetic pairs of policy text + agent quote.

**Input:**
```
Ground truth policy:
Agents must complete 3-of-5 identity verification before any financial adjustment.

Agent statement:
I need to verify your account number and PIN before we adjust anything.
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{ "verdict": "Contradiction", "nli_category": "Contradiction", "justification": "..." }
```

Categories: Entailment | Benign Deviation | Contradiction | Policy Hallucination

**Scoring:** Exact category match vs GT verdict. Dual-label GT refs (e.g. `Contradiction / Policy Hallucination`) accept either valid label. Some boundary pairs (Contradiction vs Policy Hallucination on invented rules) are treated as equivalent when evidence supports it.

**Winner model:** `kimi-k2.5:cloud`

#### Worked example — `nli_003` (correct)

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **Policy** | Agents must complete **3-of-5** identity verification before any financial adjustment. |
| **Agent says** | *"Before we adjust anything, I need to verify your account number and PIN."* (only 2 factors) |
| **GT verdict** | `Contradiction` |
| **Model output** | `{ "verdict": "Contradiction", "justification": "Only two verification factors; policy requires 3-of-5." }` |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct — category matches |

#### Worked example — `nli_002` (correct)

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **Policy** | Outages under 24 hours are **not** eligible for automatic credits. |
| **Agent says** | *"Your six-hour outage doesn't meet the 24-hour threshold, so no automatic credit applies."* |
| **GT verdict** | `Entailment` |
| **Model output** | `{ "verdict": "Entailment" }` |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct

---

### 3. process_adherence (SOP step tracking) — **85.0%**

**What it represents:** Did the agent follow the SOP resolution graph for this call topic?

**Data type:** 153 synthetic transcripts with topic hint + expected SOP step catalog.

**Input:**
```
Topic hint: refund_request
Transcript: [agent/customer dialogue]
Expected resolution graph steps:
- Acknowledge customer issue
- Collect order identifier
- Verify refund eligibility window
- ...
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "missing_sop_steps": ["verify_refund_eligibility_window", "close_with_summary_and_next_steps"],
  "detected_topic": "refund_request"
}
```

**Scoring:** F1 between predicted and reference **sets of missing step keys** (fuzzy snake_case matching). Exact if F1 ≥ 0.65. Empty array `[]` when all steps present.

**Winner model:** `ministral-3:8b`

#### Worked example — `pa_001` (correct)

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **Topic** | `refund_request` |
| **Transcript** | Agent collects account number and promises refund; **skips** eligibility check and closing summary |
| **GT missing steps** | `verify_refund_eligibility_window`, `confirm_refund_method_and_timeline`, `close_with_summary_and_next_steps` |
| **Model output** | `"missing_sop_steps": ["verify_refund_eligibility_window", "close_with_summary_and_next_steps"]` |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct (high F1 — 2/3 missing steps recovered) |

#### Worked example — all steps present (correct)

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **GT missing steps** | `[]` (empty — full SOP followed) |
| **Model output** | `"missing_sop_steps": []` |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct — exact empty-set match |

---

### 4. fast_classification (topic + gibberish) — **90.3%**

**What it represents:** Fast routing label — what is this call about, and is the input nonsense?

**Data type:** 154 short utterances (call openers, noise strings).

**Input:** Single line, e.g. `"I want a refund on my last invoice"`

**Expected output:**
```json
{ "topic": "refund_request", "is_gibberish": false }
```

**Scoring:** Both `topic` and `is_gibberish` must match GT. Unknown-topic boundary cases scored leniently when topic is plausible.

**Winner model:** `ministral-3:8b`

#### Worked example — `fc_001` (correct)

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"I want a refund on my last invoice"` |
| **GT** | `topic: refund_request`, `is_gibberish: false` |
| **Model output** | `{ "topic": "refund_request", "is_gibberish": false }` |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct |

#### Worked example — `fc_002` (correct)

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"asdfgh jkl qwerty"` |
| **GT** | `topic: unknown`, `is_gibberish: true` |
| **Model output** | `{ "topic": "unknown", "is_gibberish": true }` |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct |

#### Worked example — `fc_003` (correct)

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **Input** | `"My internet speed has been terrible since Tuesday"` |
| **GT** | `topic: technical_support`, `is_gibberish: false` |
| **Model output** | `{ "topic": "technical_support", "is_gibberish": false }` |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct |

---

### 5. rag_judge (RAG compliance) — **98.0%**

**What it represents:** Given retrieved policies + agent transcript, is the agent compliant?

**Data type:** 150 synthetic policy+transcript bundles.

**Input:**
```
--- COMPANY POLICIES ---
[FIN-RULE-001 | Refund Policy > Outage Credits]
Outages of 24+ hours qualify for pro-rated credits...

--- AGENT TRANSCRIPT ---
Agent verified identity, confirmed outage, applied credit...
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{ "compliance_score": 0.92, "violations": [], "cited_rules": ["FIN-RULE-001"] }
```

**Scoring:** Derived verdict (Compliant / Partially compliant / Non-compliant) + rule ID must match GT reference.

**Winner model:** `qwen3.5:cloud`

#### Worked example — `rj_001` (correct)

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **Policy** | FIN-RULE-001: 24+ hour outages → pro-rated bill credit |
| **Transcript** | Agent verified identity, confirmed 44h outage, applied $23.33 credit |
| **GT** | Compliant, cites FIN-RULE-001 |
| **Model output** | `"compliance_score": 0.92`, no violations |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct — compliant verdict |

#### Worked example — `rj_002` (correct)

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **Policy** | CS-RULE-008: must not talk over customer or use dismissive tone |
| **Transcript** | Agent interrupted twice, curt responses (*"Yeah, I hear you"*) |
| **GT** | Non-compliant, violation CS-RULE-008 |
| **Model output** | `"compliance_score": 0.2`, cites communication violation |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct — non-compliant verdict + rule |

---

### 6. text_to_sql (manager assistant) — **74.0%**

**What it represents:** Manager asks a question; model generates SQL against call analytics DB.

**Data type:** 50 NL questions with reference SQL against seeded PostgreSQL schema.

**Input:**
```
Organization ID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
Question: Who are the top 5 agents by overall score?
```

**Expected output:** Raw SQL `SELECT ... JOIN ... ORDER BY ... LIMIT 5`

**Scoring:** Both GT SQL and model SQL are **executed** on readonly DB. Exact if result sets match (not string comparison).

**Winner model:** `qwen3.5:cloud`

#### Worked example — `sql_002` (correct)

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **Question** | Who are the top 5 agents by overall score? |
| **GT SQL** | `SELECT u.name, ROUND(AVG(s.overall_score)... FROM users u JOIN interactions i ... JOIN interaction_scores s ... ORDER BY avg_score DESC LIMIT 5` |
| **Model SQL** | Equivalent SELECT with same joins, org filter, GROUP BY, ORDER BY DESC, LIMIT 5 |
| **Score** | ✅ Correct — both queries return identical result rows on seeded DB |

#### Worked example — wrong join (incorrect)

| | Content |
|---|---|
| **Question** | List policy violations this week |
| **GT SQL** | Joins `policy_compliance` → `company_policies` → `interactions` with date filter |
| **Model SQL** | Missing `interactions` join or wrong date filter |
| **Score** | ❌ Incorrect — execution returns different row set |

---

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Ground truth | `ollama_cloud_ground_truth_v2.json` — synthetic, stage-specific reference labels |
| Primary metric | Stage-dependent: semantic match (ES), exact category (NLI/FC/RAG), F1 set match (PA), execution match (SQL) |
| emotion_shift | **Semantic interpretation match** — GT meaning vs model label + explanation (see section above) |
| PA | F1 on missing SOP step sets (fuzzy step_key alignment) |
| SQL | Execution result match on readonly DB |
| Rate limiting | 1–3 req/min per lane (Ollama Cloud concurrency cap) |
| Checkpointing | `.checkpoint.jsonl` resume + `--retry-errors-from` for wrong-row-only retries |

## Honest Limitations

- Benchmark pool is **synthetic** — no real call-center transcripts in GT.
- `text_to_sql` at 74% reflects execution strictness, not semantic equivalence alone.
- `emotion_shift` at 77.1% uses **semantic meaning match** (not strict label-string match) — still below 80% aspirational target.
- PA and FC scorer relaxations align measurement with production intent — document when presenting to committee.
